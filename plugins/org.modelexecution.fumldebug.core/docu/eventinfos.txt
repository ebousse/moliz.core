================================
Parent Field of Events
================================

ActivityEntryEvent
--------------------------------
parent = null if activity was called by the user by calling ExecutionContext.execute()/executeStepwise()
parent = ActivityNodeEntryEvent of CallAction which called this activity


ActivityExitEvent
--------------------------------
parent = corresponding ActivityEntryEvent


ActivityNodeEntryEvent
--------------------------------
parent = ActivityEntryEvent of the containg activity


ActivityNodeExitEvent
--------------------------------
parent = corresponding ActivityNodeEntryEvent


SuspendEvent
--------------------------------
The value of the parent field depends on the location of a SuspendEvent (see below).
(1) ActivityEntryEvent of the started activity
(2) ActivityEntryEvent of the activity which contains the executed activity node
(3) ActivityEntryEvent of the activity which contains the structured activity node


BreakpointEvent
--------------------------------
A breakpoint can only be set for activity nodes.
A BreakpointEvent is issued instead of a SuspendEvent when this activity node became enabled.

parent = ActivityEntryEvent of the activity which contains the node for which the breakpoint was set.


================================
Location Field of SuspendEvent
================================
A SuspendEvent indicates the execution of a step. 
A SuspendEvent is issued if:
(1) The execution of an activity started (and the initally enabled nodes were determined)
(2) One activity node has been executed
(3) The execution of an structured activity node (also expansion region) started (and the initally enabled nodes were determined)
An suspension event is not issued if no enabled nodes exist in the activity.

The location field indicates the location at which a step occured.
(1) The activity whose execution started
(2) The activity node which was executed
(3) The structured activity node whose execution started
