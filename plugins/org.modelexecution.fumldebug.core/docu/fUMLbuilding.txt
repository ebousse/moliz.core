If changes of source code files of the fUML reference implementation have to be incorporated into the fUML.jar file (project org.modelexecution.fumldebug.core) the following steps have to be carried out:
(1) do the changes
(2) copy the changed files (and the containing package) to the project org.modelexecution.fumldebug.core
(3) set the java compiler to version 1.6
(4) build the project
(5) copy the compiled .class file of the changed .java file into the fUML.jar (optionally also the .java file)
(6) also copy the .class and .java file into the fULM reference implementation (target/fUML/src for .java, target/fUML/classes for .class)
(7) build moliz-core new (build-core.xml)
